Hey there! I'm Subhankar Sarkar, a final year B.Tech student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at Kaziranga University. üéì With a passion for technology and innovation, I've been on an exciting journey to explore the world of computer engineering.

My story began in 2015 when I completed my diploma in Computer Engineering from the esteemed Central Institute of Technology. This early exposure ignited my curiosity and set me on a path of continuous learning and growth.

Last year, I had the incredible opportunity to intern at the EICT Academy, IIT Guwahati. During this transformative one-month internship, I delved deep into the world of Exploratory Data Analysis using Python. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also instilled in me a love for data-driven problem solving.

Currently, I'm in the midst of an enriching internship at BSM International. My primary focus is on crafting an Attendance System application using JavaFX, which is seamlessly integrated with RFID Solutions. This hands-on experience is allowing me to bridge theoretical knowledge with real-world applications, and I'm relishing every moment of it.

As I stand on the threshold of completing my B.Tech journey, I'm eagerly looking forward to leveraging my skills and experiences to contribute meaningfully to the tech world. From building innovative applications to embracing challenges that push my boundaries, I'm driven by the desire to create a positive impact.

When I'm not coding or immersed in tech, you'll likely find me immersed in the captivating realms of anime, novels, comics, and manga ‚Äì my sanctuary of leisure and imagination, because life is all about balance and pursuing the things that make us unique. 

Let's connect, collaborate, and explore the endless possibilities that technology offers. Feel free to reach out for exciting discussions, collaborations, or just to say hi! üëãüèº
