Hello there! I'm [Your Name], in the final stretch of my B.Tech journey, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at Kaziranga University. 🎓 My fascination with the realm of computer engineering dates back to 2015 when I completed my diploma in Computer Engineering from the prestigious Central Institute of Technology.

Last year, an amazing opportunity came my way – an internship at the EICT Academy, IIT Guwahati. During this intensive one-month program, I was captivated by the intricacies of Exploratory Data Analysis using Python. This experience not only refined my technical prowess but also ignited a passion for data-driven solutions.

My present adventure finds me interning at BSM International, where I'm fully engrossed in developing an Attendance System application using JavaFX that seamlessly integrates with RFID Solutions. This hands-on experience is a bridge between theory and practicality, allowing me to thrive in the world of software development.

Beyond the world of coding and algorithms, you'll often find me immersed in the captivating realms of anime, novels, comics, and manga – my sanctuary of leisure and imagination. As my academic journey culminates, I'm eagerly awaiting the chance to weave together my technical skills and diverse interests to make a meaningful contribution.

Let's connect, collaborate, and explore the endless possibilities that technology offers. Feel free to reach out for exciting discussions, collaborations, or just to say hi! 👋🏼
